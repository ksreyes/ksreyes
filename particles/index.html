        </header>

        <p><b>Manila</b> is the densest city on Earth, fitting 1.8 million people into a 43 square-kilometer crucible. The 16 other cities that constitute Metro Manila, the Philippine capital, are extraordinarily crowded as well, resulting in an overall density of 22,000/km². This is twice that of New York and almost three times that of Singapore.</p>

        <p>To make these numbers more evocative, I devised what I call a <b>particles chart</b>. Compare the density of a Metro Manila city to other global cities below through the visual of colliding particles.</p>

        <p>I have set the balls to generate at various sizes, reflecting the fact that some people take up <b>more space</b> than others. Think private vehicles versus public transport, detached homes versus high-rise condominiums. The balls are also colored in proportion to <b>ethnic makeup</b>, defined as where your ancestors were living in the year 1500. Migrant ancestor balls are colored by originating continent, ordered from largest to smallest shares.</p>
